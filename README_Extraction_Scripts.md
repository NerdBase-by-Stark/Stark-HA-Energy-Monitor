Step 1: Getting Started
Prerequisites:

    Python installed: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. If you don’t, download it from python.org, and during the installation, check the option to "Add Python to PATH."
    Cloned Repository: You’ll need a copy of the Stark Energy Monitor repository on your computer.

Step 2: Understanding the Scripts

We have two main scripts to work with:

    Script to Export Specific Files: This script allows you to extract only specific files (e.g., sensor.py or config_flow.py) from the project.
    Script to Export All Files: This script will extract all relevant files and give you the entire directory structure, including file contents.

Step 3: Using the Script to Export Specific Files
What does this script do?

    It extracts only the files you mention from the repository and saves the content into a file.

How to Use:

    Navigate to the Folder: Open the folder where your Stark Energy Monitor repository is saved.

    Open Command Prompt:
        Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter.
        Navigate to the folder where you saved the script and the repository using the command:

        bash

    cd path\to\your\repo

Run the Script:

    To run the script, type the following command:

    bash

    python extract_specific_files.py path\to\file\you\want path\to\another\file

Example: If you want to extract sensor.py and config_flow.py, you can type:

bash

    python extract_specific_files.py custom_components\stark_energy_monitor\sensor.py custom_components\stark_energy_monitor\config_flow.py

    Check the Exported File:
        The script will save the extracted content in a file named Specific_File_Export_<date_time>.txt inside your Documents folder.
        Open the file to view the contents of the files you extracted.

Step 4: Using the Script to Export All Files
What does this script do?

    It extracts all relevant files from the repository and saves the content along with the directory structure.

How to Use:

    Navigate to the Folder: Open the folder where your Stark Energy Monitor repository is saved.

    Open Command Prompt:
        Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter.
        Navigate to the folder where you saved the script and the repository using the command:

        bash

    cd path\to\your\repo

Run the Script:

    To run the script, type the following command:

    bash

        python read_custom_files.py

    Check the Exported File:
        The script will save the exported content in a file named Content_Export_Stark_energy_monitor_<date_time>.txt inside your Documents folder.
        This file will contain the directory structure and the contents of all relevant files.

Step 5: Understanding the Exported Files

    The file generated will have the content of all the relevant files from the repository.
    For each file, the file name and its content are clearly labeled in the exported file. Example:

    shell

    ## File: custom_components/stark_energy_monitor/sensor.py
    (content of the file)

Common Issues and Troubleshooting

    Python Not Recognized: If you get an error saying "Python is not recognized as an internal or external command," it means Python is not installed or added to your PATH. Reinstall Python and make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

    File Not Found Error: If the script says a file is not found, make sure you provide the correct file paths in the command. You can navigate your folder and confirm the exact file names.

    Exported File Not Found: If the script runs successfully but you can’t find the exported file, check your Documents folder for the file with the name format Content_Export_Stark_energy_monitor_<date_time>.txt.

Final Notes

    These scripts are designed to make it easy for you to extract and share code from the Stark Energy Monitor repository.
    You don’t need prior coding experience to run them, but feel free to ask for help if you encounter issues.
